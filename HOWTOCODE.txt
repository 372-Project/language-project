Hi Group 5!

This is a quick intro on how to use our langauge and translator. 

To write a file, you will need to write your code into a .txt file, 
this is very important for the translator to recognize your code.
Run the translator from the command line with "python3 translate.py"
It will ask for the .txt filename without the expression. Once it gets
the file, it will create a .java file with the same name as teh .txt
file, this is the translated code. You can run the java file in an IDE
of your choice, or in the command line with "javac file.java", and then
"java file.java"

Provided will also be c.txt and e.txt with some example code. 

VARIABLE ASSIGNMENT:
var1 is 7.
var2 is "Hello World!".
var3 is T.
var4 is 7 + 4.
var5 is var1 add 7.
varBool is T AND F.

PRINTING:
print "Hello World".
print 7.
print T.
print T OR F.
print varBool.

LOOPS:
check var1 lessThan var2 perform! 
    var3 is var1 add var2.
loop! 

check var1 lessThan var2 perform! 
    var69 is var69 add 5. 
    check var1 lessThan var2 perform! 
        check var1 lessThan var2 perform! 
            var3 is var1 add var2.
        loop! 
        var3 is var3 add 2. 
        var1 is var1 add 1. 
    loop! 
    var69 is var69 add 6. 
loop!


CONDITIONALS:
given var1 lessThan var2 do! 
    var3 is var1 add var2.!

given var1 moreThan var2 do! 
    given var1 lessThan var2 do! 
        var3 is var1 add var2.! 
        var3 is var1 add var2. 
        var2 is var1 add 2.! 
    instead! 
        print F.!

CONSOLE INPUT: (Assign get to a var, var will contain the line input)
var73 is get. (for srings)

var73 is getnum. (for integers)
