% This file is an example of the different formats and uses of loop %

% This is the basic format of loops %

var1 is 0.
var2 is 10.
check var1 lessThan var2 perform!
    print var1.
    print "\n".
    var1 is var1 add 1.
loop!
print "\n".

% They can also look like this as whitespace does not matter %

check var1 moreThan 0 perform! print var1. print "\n". var1 is var1 sub 1. loop!


% Loops can be nested as well %
% For loops do not exist so the setup can get a little tedious %
print "\nPyramid\n".
rows is 5.
i is 0.
check i lessThan rows perform!
    j is 0.
    difference is rows sub i.
    check j lessThan difference perform!
        print " ".
        j is j add 1.
    loop!

    j is 0.
    size is 2 mult i.
    size is size sub 1.
    check j lessThan size perform!
        print "X".
        j is j add 1.
    loop!

    i is i add 1.
    print "\n".
loop!
print "\n".

% Another example of nested loops %
a is 0. 
check a lessThan 3 perform!
    print "Outer loop ".
    print a.
    print "\n".

    b is 0.
    check b lessThan 3 perform!
        print "Inner loop ".
        print b.
        print "\n".

        given a lessThan b do!
            print "a is less than b\n".!
        c is 0.
        check c lessThan 2 perform!
            print "Innermost loop\n".
            c is c add 1.
        loop!
        b is b add 1.
    loop!
    a is a add 1.
loop!
